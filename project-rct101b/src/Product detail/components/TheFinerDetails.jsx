      <span>Suggested usage</span>
      <p>
        -Simply push up the Elizabeth Arden logo, grab the lipstick, apply and
        go. Beauty Expert Tip: -To find your perfect shade, test lipstick on the
        inside of your fingertip, rather than on the back of your hand. -The pad
        of your finger closely resembles your own lip colour, so see which one
        looks best there, then move to the lips.
